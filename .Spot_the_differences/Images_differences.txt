From the visual differences listed above, the following might affect the testing outcomes:
1. "My Accounts" heading will fail the test if it is located by text. Object needs to be located by role and heading level.
    Also, visual user experience could be impacted by the misspelled word.
2. Account number position is irrelevant for the test status if the object is located by any unique attribute like: "id", "name", etc.
    However, visual user experience could be impacted by the position of the element.
3. Buttons availability will fail the test case since 2 objects will not be located.
     Also, visual user experience could be impacted by the lack of possible functionalities.
